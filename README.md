# Electro-AI

<p>
Electro AI is a deep learning model leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict electricity consumption in Delhi. By incorporating key factors such as temperature, humidity, population growth, and real estate trends, the model delivers precise hourly, weekly, and yearly forecasts. Ideal for utility management, Electro AI optimizes power distribution, reduces outages, and enhances planning for energy providers. This model is designed to meet the challenges of dynamic urban environments, improving the efficiency and reliability of electricity supply.

## Models

1. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**
    - A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed for sequential data, where connections form cycles, allowing it to retain information from previous inputs.
    - **Layers:** In our RNN model, using 7 layers provided the optimal balance for achieving high accuracy on both the DOM and PJME datasets.
    - **Epochs:** We found that 32 epochs provided the optimal balance for effective learning.
    - **Problem:** RNNs struggle with learning long-term dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem, which LSTM networks address.

2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specialized RNN variant that addresses the problem of long-term dependency by using memory cells.
    - **Layers:** In our LSTM model, using 7 layers provided the optimal balance for high accuracy.
    - **Epochs:** We found that 32 epochs provided the optimal balance for effective learning.
