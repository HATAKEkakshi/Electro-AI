# Electro-AI
<p>
Electro AI is a deep learning model leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict electricity consumption in Delhi. By incorporating key factors such as temperature, humidity, population growth, and real estate trends, the model delivers precise hourly, weekly, and yearly forecasts. Ideal for utility management, Electro AI optimizes power distribution, reduces outages, and enhances planning for energy providers. This model is designed to meet the challenges of dynamic urban environments, improving the efficiency and reliability of electricity supply.</p>
